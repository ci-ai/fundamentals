**Industrial use cases of computer vision technologies**

* Video surveillance
* Machine/vehicular object detection/identification/avoidance
* Medical image analysis
* Augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) development
* Localization and mapping
* Converting paperwork into digital data
* Human emotion analysis
* Ad insertions into images and video
* Face recognition
* Real estate development optimization

* Deep learning has become the technology of choice. Traditional computer
vision algorithms have focused on feature identification and then classifying an
image into a category for recognition. Deep learning, on the other hand, works via
statistical analysis of the image and comes up with a tag that describes the image.
While traditional computer vision algorithms work well in many instances, they start
to lose accuracy when the features start deviating from predefined features. For
example, it gets harder and harder to recognize a face when facial features like
beards start appearing. Deep learning algorithms overcome this limitation and
promise to improve the quality of results. This means that some of the popular
algorithms today, such as edge detection, will eventually go away and the
importance of libraries like OpenCV will diminish.

*  The use of TensorFlow for computer vision-based product design has
surpassed the used of Caffe and has been achieved fairly quickly. According to
the November 2017 Computer Vision Developer Survey from the Embedded Vision
Alliance, 65% of surveyed developers were using TensorFlow for creating, training,
or evaluating neural networks for computer vision product development. This
compares to 58% using Caffe. These numbers are not additive, of course, because
some developers are using both. 

* There are large investments in processors and IP for computer vision. This is
occurring on the server side and for edge and on-device designs. There are the
larger, well-known companies, such as Google, Intel, and Qualcomm, as well as
companies that are well-known specifically in the computer vision market, such as
Cadence, CEVA, Silica, and Videantis. In all, about 50 companies are developing
processors for computer vision. Expect a shakeout with a flurry of acquisitions and
some smaller companies failing.

* FPGAs have started to appear as a credible threat to GPUs on the server side.
FPGAs came into prominence when Microsoft announced that it would utilize
FPGAs for its search engines. FPGAs promise a higher performance per watt and
provide excellent flexibility to adapt to different algorithms as they are
programmable. Intel is also planning to embed Alteraâ€™s FPGAs on a single die that
would enable central processing units (CPUs) to easily communicate with the
FPGA fabric. FPGA development flow, nevertheless, remains cumbersome and
vendors are actively working on addressing that issue. Power consumption matters
when there are massive server farms doing cloud computing.

* DSPs and vision processing units (VPUs) are posing a strong threat to GPUs
on the end product side because not only are they being used where power is a
major consideration, but they are increasingly being used in applications where
power consumption is typically a secondary consideration. GPUs seem to be more
of a brute force approach to compute power, while DSPs and VPUs are a more
tailored solution.

* OpenVX continues to mature. The OpenVX standard, developed by the Khronos
Group, was in the early specification stages during the 2015 timeframe and is now
ready for deployment. AMD is one of the key contributors to OpenVX.

* More startups, a larger set of application markets, and continued media buzz
have more companies introducing computer vision-based products. These
products range from smartphone pluggable devices to complex self-navigating
agricultural robots. More companies are also being funded by venture capital (VC)
firms, which bodes well for the computer vision industry in general.

* The industry is still experiencing a shortage of engineers with expertise in
deep learning. While many universities have introduced programs focusing on
computer vision and deep learning, the demand outstrips the supply. Companies
with deep pockets like Facebook and Google are continuing to attract top talent,
leaving little room for others.
